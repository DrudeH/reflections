How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made me focus on only the lines that could be different

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Make sure that I don't loose important information between revisions.
    Make sure tat other people can actually look at my progress.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More logical commits. Would maybe be nice to have a .temp save as well,
    a little bit like in the Office programs - this way I won't loose 
    everything if I forget to save in a while.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's very practical for file types that are usually related. 
    I would fx love it in Matlab.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use them to get an overview of the commits created or 
    I can use them to compare two specific files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes the risk of not being able to find my bug smaller. 
    Though it is still a quite tedious process - it will probably be quicker

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I basically just want to be sure I know how to use it so I can continue
    with the Android Beginner Course
