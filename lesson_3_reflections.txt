When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  For the same reasons I am using Dropbox. It offers so many possibilities,
  if you pc breaks down, if you are working from different work stations,
  if you are cooperating with someone on a project, etc. etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	For the same reason I want to manually create my local commits.
	I will have to remember to upload, but I will only get the commits
	that makes logically sense. Furthermore, I might, not want to 
	upload all branches of a specific repository to GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: 		When copying someone elses repositories in GitHub to my own.
				Especially useful when I'm usings someones work as basis.
	Clones:		When I move my own repositories from between my remotes.
				Especially useful in daily work.
	Branches:	When I am working inside a repository and want to create 
				different tracks. Especially useful for larger edits.
