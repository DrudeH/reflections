What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I create a hidden .git directory to stash my old commits.
	I need it to use version control and git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temporary place to define the files that should be a part of 
	your next commit. It freezes the files, but does not save

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
    In case of several corrections at the same time I can introduce a commit
    for each logical change - work is not necesarily as linear as the records

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?
	Basically in any case where I want to have two different versions.
	Im Matlab or LaTeX this could be when I introduce a new module in
	my program or when I change the font in my report
