What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I create a hidden .git directory to stash my old commits.
	I need it to use version control and git
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temporary place to define the files that should be a part of 
	your next commit. It freezes the files, but does not save
